## Our Dashboard visualization

### App description

The app contains three charts that explores 3 different research questions on jobs and unemployment across industries. We hope this can be incorporated as a framework for policymakers to understand their countries unemployment trends across industries. The three tabs display interactive charts that allow users to choose jobs, years of interest, or both that can increase their understanding of unemployment trends for the respective country. The first tab, "Job Growth Across Industries," shows a graph on industries unemployment changes for a range of years. In the second tab, "Unemployment Over Years", users can filter for a specific industry of their interest or multiple industries. In the third tab, "Seasonal Unemployment," both the slider and the dropdown checklist will allow users to filter the industries and specify the year at the same time. In all three tabs a radio button will allow users to choose how they would like to visualize the data (i.e. show the rates or counts).

### Functionality of our app

<b> Tab 1: Job Growth Across Industries</b>

* Visualize the statistic using rate for percent change or count for absolute change.
* Slider for the year range between 2000 and 2010.
* User can see the difference between industries in how they are doing during the range of years in unemployment. 


<b> Tab 2: Employment over Years</b>

* Visualize the statistic using rate for percent change or count for absolute change.
* Multi-select drop down option to choose one or multiple industries to look at their unemployment changes from 2000-2010. 
* This graph allows users to compare in trends of unemployments on different industries across long term changes as well as the average unemployment for all industries. 


<b> Tab 3: Seasonal Unemployment</b>

* This graph combines the first two graph's functions of choosing to view a statistic in either rate or count, choosing multiple industries, and selecting the year of interest.
* We can see the trend of unemployment for a given year and see trends in seasons.
* This graph allows users to compare the seasonal unemployments between different industries and the average for all industries.
* This can help prepare governments and industries when to expect job losses, etc.
